<!--

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  Again it was a good experience overall. We were able to think out our thoughts to each other and were able to quickly resolve any speed bumps in our creation process. We were able to use <div> tags to organinize our sections
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I found wireframing to be extremely useful. It helps with the coding aspect of creating a basic skelatal structure of the page.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We decided having all the usual title bar and footer, but for the content of the page we decided to include nested links for navigation as well as the blog content itself.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  I learned that <div> elements are NOT semantic. I did not learn any new semantic tags.
