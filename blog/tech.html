    <h2>Real World Recursions</h2>
    <p>
      Where can we find recursion in real life examples? They're literally everywhere in Nature. It's usually too fine and small to detect. For example when a large head of brocolli is broken into smaller pieces, it's pieces look like the bigger brocolli from which it came from! That's because the pattern in which brocolli grows is recursive. It repeats its pattern, to make a bigger whole.

    <h2>And Recursion in Programming?</h2>
    <p>
      Simply, in programming recursion occurs when a method is called inside it's method instructions.</p>
