  <h1>Ruby Hashes vs. JavaScript Objects</h1>
  <h2>Hash? Object? What are they?</h2>

    <h2>Tables, tables, tables!</h2>
    <p>
      We all know what a simple table looks like right? On a table it has a left side, and it's corresponding right side value. Computers use these tables with these corresponding entries all the time. The corresponding pairs are usally called key & value pairs. In Ruby, these tables are called hashes, and in JavaScript they are called objects.
    </p>
    <h2>So how are they alike? How are they different?</h2>
    <p>
      Ruby hashes and objects are similar in that they both have corresponding pairs and that they can contain different things.
      In Ruby we call these key/value pairs. In JavaScript Objects, we call them property/value pairs. In Ruby there are two ways of storing key/values in literal notation: Hash Rocket Style and a style adopted from JavaScript.
      <xmp>
        #Ruby hash rocket style:

        hash = { "one" => 1,
                 "two" => 2,
                 "three" => 3}

        # JavaScript /Ruby style:

        object = { one: 1,
                   two: 2,
                   three: 3}
      </xmp>

      <p> It is important to know in Ruby 1.9 hashes built with (:) colons can ONLY be used on symbols. Otherwise, for other type of objects, Ruby docs recommend using Hash rocket notation hashes. And that's it folks! </p>
