    <h2>Index, index, index!</h2>
    <p>The quick and dirty...  Arrays and Hashes both store objects. For the most part Arrays have a order that is organized by a INDEX! The index always starts at 0 and goes up. So index 0 of sample_array will be the first number, index 1 of sample_array will be the second number and etc. </p>
    <xmp>
      Array = ['apple', 3, "blue"]

    </xmp>

    <p>
        However, when it comes to Hashes they have a INDEX as well. But their index in s of numberical order, but a random order. Instead of a number, values are retreived by using KEYS for INDEX
    </p>
    <xmp>
      Hash = {
      :color => orange
      :sky => blue
    }
    </xmp>

    <p>
        There's more, but that what I think the major difference between a array and a hash is!
