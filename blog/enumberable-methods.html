    <h2>First: What is a enumberable? What is iteration?</h2>
    <p>
      An enumberable could be described as a collection of objects that are handled in a container. That number of things can be done to that container. We could 'look' into the container, or we can use each object in the container as a source of input for a block of code to be repeated on. That's what iteration is. Iteration is the repeating of a block of code with some kind of input and return-ing an output.
    </p>
    <h2>How Enumberable#group_by is used.</h2>
    <p>
      There's always a input and an output. The Enumberable#group_by will take each object in the 'container' and use each object in the code block until it has gone thru each object. #group_by will "iterate" through each object and group them up based on the code block provided
    </p>
    <p>
      <xmp>
        arrary_or_hash.group_by {|object| object.length}
        #=> # Returns a hash grouped according to the code block
      </xmp>
    </p>
