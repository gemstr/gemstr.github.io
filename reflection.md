##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
- I learned that they are very different, and allow to control the div object finely. They also determine where a div element will be placed.
##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
- I learned the differences between normal(static), relative, absolute, and fixed positions and floating elements.
##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
- I found the headers, and footers to be the easiest to design because they are the top and bottom of the page.
##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
-One of the few things I learned was CSS frustration can be saved if each css property is properly closed with (;). I also learned how to use the clear:both property to clear left and right floating elements. I think my site still looks ugly, althought my blog posts are looking great.
